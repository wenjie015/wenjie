    title: About Me
    summary: |
     I received the B.S. degree in Automation and the Ph.D. degree in Control Science and Engineering from University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China, in 2010 and 2015, respectively. From June 2015 to June 2017, I was a Lecturer with School of Computer Science and Control Engineering, North University of China. Since July 2017, I am a Lecturer with School of Electrical and Control Engineering, North University of China. My current research focuses on Quantum Systems Control, Prognostic and Health Management.
